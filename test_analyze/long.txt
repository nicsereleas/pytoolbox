Data science is a field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms,
and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.
It applies techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context
of mathematics, statistics, computer science, domain knowledge, and information science.

Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data science.
It provides powerful libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

With Python, you can build models, clean and analyze data, and create powerful
visualizations. The flexibility and simplicity of Python make it a favorite tool
for beginners and professionals alike.
